# Master's Project 2022-2023: Source Separation for Robot Control

This particular branch contains artifacts by Leon Mannweiler, Henning MÃ¶llers, and Vadim Titov used to perform multichannel speech enhancement, on the one hand with classical (MVDR) and on the other hand with state-of-the-art Deep Neural Network algorithms (LSTM). The source code for the former is located in [`./beamformer/implementation`](/beamformer/implementation/), while the one for the latter in [`./dnn/implementation`](/dnn/implementation/)
